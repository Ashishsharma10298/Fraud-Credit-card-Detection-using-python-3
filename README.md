# Fraud-Credit-card-Detection-using-python-3



Ever since starting my journey into data science, 
I have been thinking about ways to use data science for good while generating value at the same time.
Thus, when I came across this data set on Kaggle dealing with credit card fraud detection, I was immediately hooked.
The data set has 31 features, 28 of which have been anonymized and are labeled V1 through V28.
The remaining three features are the time and the amount of the transaction as well as whether that transaction was
fraudulent or not. Before it was uploaded to Kaggle, the anonymized variables had been modified in 
the form of a PCA (Principal Component Analysis). Furthermore, there were no missing values in the data set. 
Equipped with this basic description of the data, 
letâ€™s jump into some exploratory data analysis.
